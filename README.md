# Tissue Design Sketchbook

A lightweight, interactive tool for bio-design prototyping.

## Features

- **Sketch-based Interface:** Hand-drawn aesthetic using RoughJS.
- **Drag & Drop:** Build tissue constructs layer by layer.
- **Visual Logic:** Real-time feedback on biological compatibility (no numbers!).
- **Stability Indicator:** A balance scale helper to guide structural integrity.

## How to Run

1.  This project uses standard HTML/CSS/JS modules.
2.  Because it uses ES Modules (`import/export`), you need a local server.
3.  If you have Python installed (which you do), run:

    ```powershell
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```

4.  Open your browser to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Offline Usage
The file `rough.js` is included locally, so the app will work without internet access once the server is running.
